# Practice with DOM Manipulation

In this brief assignment, I was given a simple HTML document and had to write a series of scripts which return or modify elements in it.
ie.
- Make all sad classes into happy ones.
- Make the annoying popup link point instead to http://www.cashcats.biz.
- Replace the form input with a <textarea> instead of a <input type="text">.
