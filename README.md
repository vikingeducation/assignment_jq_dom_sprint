...that DOM, D-DOM DOM DOOOOM...
<h3>Maddie Rajavasireddy</h3>

<h4>Assignment Description</h4>
The objective is for the scripts in the script file to cause the desired changes in the HTML page. We can't edit the HTML -- only the JavaScript. Whenever the page refreshes, it should look the way we want it to and not the way it originally was.

  Change the `<h1>` to something cheeky  
  
  Inside the container for "Upcoming Traversals", create and insert an ordered list of upcoming traversals.  
  
  Make all sad classes into happy ones.  
  
  Make the annoying popup link point instead to http://www.cashcats.biz.  
  
  Change the positioning of the annoying popup so it is on the right side of the screen (it's okay to use direct CSS here).     Make it 30 pixels lower than its current position by utilizing its current top value.  
  
  Replace the ellipsis ... in one of the suggested topics with the content of your choice -- but do so by traversing from a     different element.  
  
  Replace the form input with a <textarea> instead of a `<input type="text">`.
